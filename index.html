 As-salam alaykum, to whom it concerns, 
Read the paragraph marked in ** if this message is too long for you

As time passes, we realize our own mistakes and its a noble endeavor to seek to change them. I have my own reasons for doing the following which I'd like for people to respect and I ask from you to know that this is only for the betterment of Muslims and not an impulsive change. 

** After months of thought and discussion, I permanently deleted my defendingislam pdf. and I ask that everyone who possesses a copy of it to delete their copy too, and for anyone who uploaded it online or has links of it on other servers to delete them, and to make no mention of the document anymore nor to utilize the info uploaded on it nor share it with people.

I don't permit anyone to possess a copy of it, keeping in mind the PDF is my own Islamic property. I wouldn't like for it to be read anymore except for those who I give explicit written, permission to.

I absolve myself of any responsibility in regards to the wrong information contained in the PDF. The information written inside does not necessarily reflect my current opinion of what I view to be correct. 

And Allah replaces with what is better, inshaAllah. 
Please share my message with people.
